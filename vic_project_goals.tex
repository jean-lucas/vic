% Problem Statement
\section{Problem Statement}
The project seeks to solve the intersection navigation problem of autonomous vehicles. Currently, autonomous vehicles are unable to navigate intersections when two or more vehicles arrive at the same intersection at the same time. Once the vehicles arrive at the intersection there is no decision mechanism to decide which vehicle or vehicles will proceed first and which vehicles proceed next in real time. In addition, there is no mechanism to deal with a dynamically changing intersection over extended periods of time.

% Product Purpose
\section{Product Purpose}
The purpose of this  project is to provide a solution that will allow autonomous cars to identify intersections and form a consensus of which vehicle or vehicles proceed first among the vehicles currently at the  intersection. In addition, this product will be able to deal with a dynamically changing over extended periods of time without running into deadlock situations. The project will also provide a solution that will allow cars to safely navigate through the intersection after a proceed decision has been made. This project will also use current solutions to allow the autonomous vehicle to follow lanes and detect obstacles in the drive path. 

% Wassyng suggested that we set a few goals that, when met, the project 
% would be considered a success 
\section{Project Goals that Constitute Success }
The project will be considered a success if the following goals are met:
\begin{enumerate}
	\setlength\itemsep{-0.3em}
	\item The autonomous vehicle must be able in identify an intersection 
	\item A general consensus algorithm that decides which vehicle or vehicles proceed first and use fair decision making
	\item The system indicates the order that vehicles will proceed through the intersection
\end{enumerate}

% Project Goals
% This is the intended project goals that the group wants to meet
\section{Project Goals}
The intended goals for this project: 
\begin{enumerate}
	\setlength\itemsep{-0.3em}
	\item The autonomous vehicle must be able to follow lanes and avoid obstacles
	\item The autonomous vehicle must be able to identify intersections 
	\item A general consensus algorithm that decides which vehicle or vehicles proceed first and use fair decision making
	\item The traffic flow of the intersection must be optimized
	\item The autonomous vehicle must be able to navigate through an intersection
	\item The system must follow the current laws of the road 
\end{enumerate}

% Extended Project Goals
\section{Extended Project Goals}
Extended project goals:
\begin{enumerate}
	\setlength\itemsep{-0.3em}
	\item The system should be modular to be allow integration into multiple system
	\item The system should be capable to handling multiple intersection types
	\item The system should be capable of filtering out invalid signals to the system
\end{enumerate}
